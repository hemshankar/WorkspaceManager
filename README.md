# Workspace Manager

â€¢	Motivation Behind Workspace Manager

o	Tech keeps changing really fast, from native, to hadoop, to cloud, to microservices and so does the environment and workspace.
o	Generally, the setup required is achieved by initial developers working in the project using terminal, notepad, gedit, scripts etc.
o	These things can generally be not shared across the users/developers. Also, when the system crashes whole setup is gone, and needs to be recreated from scratch.
o	Docs created for setup becomes outdated as the tech changes or updates, or with requirements, and if not updated properly becomes stale.


Developing Workspace Manager with following requirements and features:

1. Workspace can be shared across developers and users. New users can easily onboard in notime as they do not have to do through all the doc and can just click through to setup the workspace.
2. Workspace can be checked in to the git and can be versioned.
3. Status of the host can be monitored. Also multiple Hosts and workspaces can be used and monitored together.
4. Tasks in workspace can be combined to achieve something higher.
5. Tasks can be executed and monitored parallelly. Nice graphs and stats of host and tasks can be shown.
6. In case some of the setup do not work in the WS, it can be fixed via JIRAs, so the WS will be executable every time, unlike document which can get outdated.
7. WS can be uploaded and shared in a common location so that any user can browse and select the doc and start using it.
8. Each task can be attached with description and doc.
9. User should be able to add custom widget/app, that can be plugged in by other users.
10. WS Publish to PDF or web-DOC.
11. Special options for showing docker container and other similar process status
12. Output of the tasks can be cached and retrieved later.
13. Packages can be installed, and complete programs can be run.
14. Provide basic file browsers, for containers as well.
15. Provide basic terminal facility.
16. Provide AI assistance.

## MISC

To build and run the project:

1. Use a command window to change into the example project directory, for example: `cd play-scala-hello-world-web`

2. Build the project. Enter: `sbt run`. The project builds and starts the embedded HTTP server. Since this downloads libraries and dependencies, the amount of time required depends partly on your connection's speed.

3. After the message `Server started, ...` displays, enter the following URL in a browser: <http://localhost:9000>

The Play application responds: `Welcome to the Hello World Tutorial!`
